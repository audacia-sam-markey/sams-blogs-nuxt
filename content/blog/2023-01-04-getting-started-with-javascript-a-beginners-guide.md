introduction: JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to
  create interactive websites and web applications. It is a client-side
  scripting language, which means that it is executed by the user's web browser
  rather than the web server. JavaScript is an essential tool for front-end web
  development and is used to create interactive elements on websites, like
  forms, menus, and games.
