**There's nothing quite like a warm, gooey chocolate brownie straight out of the oven. If you're craving some homemade brownies but aren't sure where to start, don't worry! Baking chocolate brownies is easier than you might think, and with a little bit of practice, you'll be a pro in no time.**

To start, you'll need the following ingredients:

* 1 cup unsalted butter, melted
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1 cup light brown sugar
* 4 large eggs
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup cocoa powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 cup chocolate chips (optional)

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the melted butter and sugars until well combined. Add in the eggs one at a time, stirring well after each addition. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips, if using.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for a few minutes before cutting and serving.
