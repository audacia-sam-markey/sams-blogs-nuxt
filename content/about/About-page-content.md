Hi there! My name is Sam and I am the creator of EveriRead, a blog dedicated to all things literature.

Ever since I was young, I have had a love for reading. There is something so magical about getting lost in a good book and I wanted to create a space where others could share in that love. On EveriRead, you can expect to find book reviews, reading lists, and discussions on all types of literature.

I am a firm believer in the power of words and the impact they can have on our lives. Whether it's a heart-wrenching memoir or a thrilling fantasy novel, each and every book has the ability to change us in some way. I hope that through EveriRead, I can help others discover the joy of reading and all the wonderful stories that the world has to offer.

In addition to running EveriRead, I am also an avid traveler and coffee lover. When I'm not lost in a book, you can usually find me exploring a new city or sipping on a latte. Thank you for stopping by and I hope you find something here that resonates with you.
